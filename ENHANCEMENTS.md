## Technical Implementation Details

### Data Structures Added:

```python
# Settings expansions
class Settings:
    show_grid: bool = True
    piece_style: str = "traditional"
    font_size_multiplier: float = 1.0
    zoom_level: float = 1.0
    board_rotation: int = 0
    show_move_preview: bool = True
    show_hint_intensity: bool = True
    per_difficulty_stats: Dict[int, PlayerStats] = {}
```

```python
# UI State additions
class UIState:
    replay_mode: bool = False
    replay_index: int = 0
    replay_playing: bool = False
    replay_speed: float = 1.0
    ai_thinking: bool = False
    ai_think_start: float = 0.0
    hover_pos: Optional[Tuple[int, int]] = None
```

### New Classes:

1. **ReplayMode** - Handles all replay functionality
2. **HintSystem** - AI-powered move recommendations  
3. **GameExporter** - PGN/JSON export functionality

### Modified Systems:
