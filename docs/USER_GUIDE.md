## Game Rules

### Reversi/Othello Basics

**Objective:** Have more pieces of your color on the board when the game ends.

**Setup:**
- 8×8 board (customizable to 4×4 through 16×16)
- 4 pieces placed in center:
  ```
      3 4 5 6
    3 . . . .
    4 . W B .
    5 . B W .
    6 . . . .
  ```
  Black plays first.

**Making Moves:**
1. Place your piece on an empty square
2. You must flank opponent's pieces (trap them between your pieces)
3. All flanked pieces flip to your color
4. If no legal moves, you pass
5. Game ends when:
   - Board is full, OR
   - Neither player can move

**Winning:**
- Player with most pieces wins
- Equal pieces = tie game

### Legal Moves

A move is legal if it flips at least one opponent piece:

**Example:**
```
  Current board:        After Black plays at (2,3):
  
  . . . . . . . .       . . . . . . . .
  . . . . . . . .       . . . . . . . .
  . . . . . . . .       . . B . . . . .
  . . . W B . . .       . . B B B . . .
  . . . B W . . .       . . . B W . . .
  . . . . . . . .       . . . . . . . .
  . . . . . . . .       . . . . . . . .
  . . . . . . . .       . . . . . . . .
  
  Black flips White piece at (3,4)
```

**Flanking Directions:**
- Horizontal (left/right)
- Vertical (up/down)
- Diagonal (4 directions)

**Important:**
- Must flip at least one piece
- Can flip in multiple directions simultaneously
- Cannot place on occupied squares
- Cannot place without flanking

## Strategy Guide

### Opening Strategy (Moves 1-20)

**Key Principles:**

1. **Control the Center**
   - Center squares are valuable early
   - Don't over-commit to edges early
   - Keep options open

2. **Minimize Your Mobility Loss**
   - Each move should give you future options
   - Avoid moves that limit your choices
   - Think 2-3 moves ahead

3. **Edge Piece Caution**
   - Early edge pieces can be dangerous
   - They're hard to defend
   - Exception: Setting up corners

**Good Opening Moves:**
```
Black's first 4 legal moves (any are reasonable):

  . . . . . . . .
  . . . . . . . .
  . . ①  . ② . . .      ① (2,3) - Standard
  . . . W B . . .       ② (2,5) - Aggressive
  . . . B W . . .       ③ (5,2) - Defensive
  . . ③  . ④  . . .      ④ (5,4) - Balanced
  . . . . . . . .
  . . . . . . . .
```

### Mid-Game Strategy (Moves 20-50)

**Key Principles:**

1. **Corner Strategy**
   - Corners are permanent (can't be flipped)
   - Control corners = control adjacent edges
   - Worth sacrificing pieces for corners

2. **Avoid X-Squares**
   ```
   X . . . . . . X    X-squares (corners of board)
   . . . . . . . .    give opponent corner access!
   . . . . . . . .    Avoid unless necessary
   . . . . . . . .
   . . . . . . . .
   . . . . . . . .
   . . . . . . . .
   X . . . . . . X
   ```

3. **Tempo Control**
   - Force opponent into bad moves
   - Limit their options
   - Create "forced" sequences

**Corner Priority:**
```
Best to Worst Squares (8×8 board):

A = Corner (Best - permanent)
B = Edge (Good - semi-stable)
C = Inner (Okay - flexible)
X = X-square (Worst - gives corners)

A X B B B B X A
X X C C C C X X
B C C C C C C B
B C C C C C C B
B C C C C C C B
B C C C C C C B
X X C C C C X X
A X B B B B X A
```

### Endgame Strategy (Last 10-15 Moves)

**Key Principles:**

1. **Count Pieces**
   - Know if you're ahead or behind
   - Play differently based on position
   - If ahead: limit opponent options
   - If behind: create chaos, take risks

2. **Parity**
   - Try to make the last move
   - Last move often swings the game
   - Count remaining empty squares

3. **Sweep Sequences**
   - Clear entire rows/columns
   - Convert edge positions
   - Lock in your advantage

**Counting Example:**
```
With 10 empty squares left:
Black: 28 pieces
White: 26 pieces

Black is ahead by 2, but:
- 10 moves left
- Each move flips 1-10+ pieces
- Game still very much in play!

Strategy: Black should play defensively
```

### AI Difficulty Strategies

**Level 1-2 (Beginner):**
- Random-ish play
- Good for learning rules
- Easy to beat with basic strategy
- Strategy: Just avoid major blunders

**Level 3-4 (Intermediate):**
- Considers piece count and mobility
- Makes occasional mistakes
- Good challenge for casual players
- Strategy: Control corners, avoid X-squares

**Level 5-6 (Expert):**
- Deep search (5-6 moves ahead)
- Rarely makes mistakes
- Very strong endgame
- Strategy: Perfect play required, study openings

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Beginner Mistakes:**
1. ❌ Playing to X-squares early
2. ❌ Ignoring corner opportunities
3. ❌ Taking many pieces every move
4. ❌ Not thinking ahead

**Intermediate Mistakes:**
1. ❌ Over-valuing piece count early
2. ❌ Giving opponent corners
3. ❌ Forgetting about parity
4. ❌ Rushing the endgame

**Advanced Mistakes:**
1. ❌ Predictable opening play
2. ❌ Ignoring tempo
3. ❌ Poor endgame counting
4. ❌ Giving up when behind

### Gameplay Questions

**Q: What's the best opening move?**  
A: All 4 initial moves are equally valid. Common choices:
- (2,3) or (5,4) - "Diagonal" opening (balanced)
- (2,5) or (5,2) - "Parallel" opening (aggressive)
Research suggests minimal advantage to any particular opening.

**Q: Should I try to get as many pieces as possible early?**  
A: **No!** This is a common beginner mistake. Early piece count doesn't matter. Focus on:
- Controlling corners
- Maintaining mobility
- Good positional play

**Q: What if I have no legal moves?**  
A: You must pass. The game automatically passes for you and gives your opponent another turn. If neither player can move, game ends.

**Q: Can I take back moves?**  
A: Yes! Press 'U' to undo. You can undo multiple moves. However:
- Undo is disabled in tournament mode
- AI will re-think after undo
- Cannot undo after game ends

**Q: How does the AI work?**  
A: The AI uses Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning:
- Searches move tree 1-6 moves ahead
